<p>
Due to some reasons, it is not possible to access and use well-known websites and
applications such as Google and Facebook in mainland China. This article does not intend
to discuss these reasons. My purpose is to enable people to use these services to
facilitate their work, study, life, and entertainment. Everything else has nothing to do
with me. Any problems that come with it are the responsibility of the individual.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of simplicity, I only discuss how to do it and achieve the desired effect,
not to talk about why. The structure discussed in this article is based on various systems
and hardware platforms. The main hardware platforms include mobile phones and
computers. There are Android and iOS operating systems in the mobile platform. The
computer platform is divided into three systems: Linux, Windows, and Mac. So next I will
follow these classifications to discuss how to achieve the access to Google and other
sites on these platforms.
